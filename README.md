# Neural-Decoding

This neural-decoding project is a research that I had been working on 
for about a year as my master's thesis topic. 

The 'nd_lib_v3.py' file is the main library written by me. It contains many features, 
including feature scaling, data labeling, data splitting, trials averaging, PCA, 
feature extraction, training/testing ML models, etc. 

On the other hand, Dmitry Patashov created the 'WU_MEG_DP.py' file. 
He is a post-doctor researcher at Waseda University, 
and we have been working together for about a year. 
'WU_MEG_DP' is the library for preprocessing, including epoching, 
filtering, outliers removal, etc.  

'Post_Processing.py' is the library used for creating the graphs for
evaluating the results we got from ML classifiers, including bar chart, 
time-series graph, etc. Unfortunately, I can't upload the raw data 
we collected from the experiment we did in August 2021. 
Therefore, you cannot test all the features using those scripts from scratch yourself.
